	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>Grew up in Hangzhou, China and obtained the Bachelor of Finance (Honours) degree with the University Medal from Australian National University in 2020. 
		My current research interests are asset pricing and behavioral finance. 
		And I am really excited to join the Finance PhD program in Stockholm School of Economics this fall. 
		I love soccer, reading and playing Go and I am still in the process of learning piano in my spare time.
		One Fun Fact, I used to be a soccer coach for one and a half year in Australia. </p>
