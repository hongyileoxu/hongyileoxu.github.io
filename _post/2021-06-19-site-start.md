Well, this is a starting point for the builing of my personal academic webiste. A lot of things need to learn as a neophyte, but this is much more interesting than I thought.
By the way, this [web](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) does teach me a lot and it will be a great start for people who want to build their own webpage on Github.
