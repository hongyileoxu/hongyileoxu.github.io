This note is crested to record additional thoughts for the "Under the spotlight" project. 

1.	This JFE paper shares the same setting as the one you have and there are extensions you can do to make the whole story richer. For instance, I can use the shorting interest in the market to re-do the analysis. > [Competition of the informed: Does the presence of short sellers affect insider selling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X15001439). 
2.	A follow up question there is when the funds are not used for share repurchases in this month, where do they go? 
	-	Maybe they are used for repurchases in other periods? 
	-	Maybe they are used for future investments? 
	-	Or maybe used to reduce cost of capital? 
	-	etc. 
3.	One future route to promote this paper is to link it to the failure of return predictability literature even when including the share repurchase information. 
4. Call my paper - "Quantity Dynamics of Limited Attention".

 	- also check this paper <u>Foucault, T., Fresard, L., 2014. Learning from peers’ stock prices and corporate investment. Journal of Financial Economics 111, 554–577. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.11.006
</u> using TNIC to identify peer firms and examine different (in-)attention measures. E.g. use TNIC to exclude attention to related firms and use this measure of "external attention" as the new IV variable.
	- also as suggested by [Hulai Zhang](https://hulaizh.github.io), use EDGAR downloading data to augment the argument and identify what kind of investors are driving the change in attention and provides further robust evidence on the predictions. i.e. information driven trading versus non-information driven ones.
 		-  Regarding this track, this discretion may not be necessary. If the market is fully driven by non-informed trading, it just consumes the market liquidity. Based on Hillert et al. (2014), when the market liquidity is low, firms will act as a liquidity provider and thus repurchase more shares. This actually go against my finding that the manager's repurchase action will reduce when the attention is high.
