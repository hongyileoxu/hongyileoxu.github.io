This note is crested to record additional thoughts for the "Under the spotlight" project. 

1.	This JFE paper shares the same setting as the one you have and there are extensions you can do to make the whole story richer. For instance, I can use the shorting interest in the market to re-do the analysis. > [Competition of the informed: Does the presence of short sellers affect insider selling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X15001439). 
2.	A follow up question there is when the funds are not used for share repurchases in this month, where do they go? 
	-	Maybe they are used for repurchases in other periods? 
	-	Maybe they are used for future investments? 
	-	Or maybe used to reduce cost of capital? 
	-	etc. 
3.	One future route to promote this paper is to link it to the failure of return predictability literature even when including the share repurchase information.
