## Notes from Da et al. (2011) - Search Volume Index (SVI)

1. use stock tickers in the google trend searching. > normally 1-4 characters in US
2. identify the tckers with a gneeric meaning such as “GPS,” “DNA,” “BABY,” “A,” “ B,” and “ALL.” > **flag these out**

   a. exlcude them.\
   b. replace them by the company name / company abbreviations.
   
3. notice that all data are firm-week observations.
   > "Unfortunately, Google Trends does not return a valid SVI for some of our queries. If a ticker is rarely searched, Google Trends will return a zero value for that ticker’s SVI. Of our 834,627 firm-week observations, 468,413 have a valid SVI." (Da et al. (2011))

4. alternative types of SVI:
   a. SVIs based on company name (Name SVI).
