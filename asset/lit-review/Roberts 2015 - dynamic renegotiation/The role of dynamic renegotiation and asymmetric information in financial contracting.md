Roberts, M.R., 2015. The role of dynamic renegotiation and asymmetric information in financial contracting. Journal of Financial Economics 116, 61–81. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2014.11.013](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfineco.2014.11.013)

## Abstract
- From SEC filings, the typical bank loan is renegotiated ==five times, or every nine months==. 
- Characteristics of the loan are changed and ==timing== is governed by the **financial health** of the contracting parties and **uncertainty regarding the borrowers’ credit quality**. The impact weights of these factors depend on the the duration of the lending relationship. 
	- Firm $i$ at time $t$ has a contract with a bank or institution $j$. I conjecture that contract $c_{ijt}$ will be more likely to be renegotiated than the contract $c_{jkt}$, if the lending relationship between $i$ and $j$ is longer than that between $i$ and $k$. 

## Intro 
- Collect the loan paths (life-cycle of the private loans) for a random sample of bank borrowers. & study two broad questions: 
	1. What happens in renegotiation? 
	2. When does renegotiation occur? 
	- focus on the ==duration of lending relationship== and ==number of renegotiations==. 
- Renegotiation is not very frequently caused by the covenant violations, while covenant violations generally lead to renegotiation ex post. 
- Most loans renegotiations ==happens very frequently== and lead to ==economically significant changes to the contract terms== - **pricing, amount and maturity**.  
- Around half of renegotiations modify only the covenant package. 
- the timing of renegotiations is governed by three factors: the financial health of the parties to the loan, the uncertainty regarding borrowers’ future profitability, and the outcome of renegotiation. 
- Loan renegotiations dynamically complete the incomplete contract. 
- While contracts, via covenants and other contractual contingencies, **allocate control rights ex ante** (e.g., Aghion and Bolton, 1992; Dewatripont and Tirole, 1994), ==renegotiation allocates control rights ex post==. 
- [!!!] The finding that borrowers grant creditors strong control rights suggests that information asymmetry in conjunction with agency problems is an important element of the contracting environment (e.g., Dessein, 2005; Garleanu and Zwiebel, 2009). 
	- This finding presents a challenge for ==theories predicated on symmetric information and hold-up (Hart and Moore, 1998)==, in which the relative importance of borrower effort for the success of the funded investment dictates that the borrower should retain strong control rights. 
	- Further, the persistence of strong creditor control rights throughout the lending relationship suggests that information asymmetry about the investments, if not the borrower, is persistent. 
- find that increasing borrower uncertainty accelerates the onset of renegotiation, indicating the trade-off between the costly, early information acquisition and potential future transfers (loss?). 

## Data 
- unit of observation: the renegotiation event. 
- observations are not independent. 
- identify renegotiation events and ==changes from renegotiations==: SEC filings. 
	- *==a placebo test== is that for more contracts with more dispersed debtholders/ credit owners, the item of interest should have no effect*. 
- extract all available loan (a.k.a. tranche or facility) information from Dealscan. 
- identify ==originations and renegotiations for each of these firms== by examining the SEC filings available in electronic form on the *Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval* (*EDGAR*) system. 
	- collect information on contracts and amendments (i.e., renegotiations), both of which are attached to the filings as exhibits. 
	- electronic filings are available from the SEC beginning only in 1994. > [May not be an issue for me!] 
- the loan path includes: 
	- origination
	- any and all renegotiations (three types)
		- amendments 
		- amended and restated agreements 
		- rollovers 
	- one of four possible terminal events
