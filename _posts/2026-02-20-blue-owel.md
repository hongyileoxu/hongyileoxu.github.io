There seems to be a huge interest in non-US assets over the past several months (the end of 2025 to the start of 2026). This inflow in EU equity synchronises with the large inflow in EM equity and outflow in US equity. The underlying narrative is that US institutional investors are seeking new places to diversify the overconcentration and overvaluation risk in US tech. 

Based on this FT article[\^2], this flow to **developed** and **emerging** EU markets started after Trump's "illegal" tariff, reversing the persistent outflow since 2022/2023 (potentially the Ukraine-Russia War). This narrative is consistent with Ray Dalio's statement about Gold. However, analysts view on the exact approach to EU, Germany + UK, markets differently. Some argues that the macro condition in EU will improve and thus a large exposure to the EU market should be the way. Others remain sceptical about this macro turnaround and focuse on specific industry exposure, defence in particular. Personally, I am interested in how this trend will play out with Trump's tariff blocked by the US Supremem Court. 

In the short run, this should further strengthen the EU market. First, now EU exporters do not need to worry too much about the trade uncertainty. Although the Trump administration can use other clause to impose tariffs, the impact of future tariffs on the EU economy and the market should be limited. Second, governments in the Euro area won't dramatically shift their spending policy, e.g. military spending. This means that the current themes should continue. With the interest rate cuts to continue, we should expect the EU market to continue its momentum in 2026.
