In the finance literature, zombie firms are defined as firms who can generate cash flows barely covering its interest payments. These firms generally have lower operating efficiency and heavy debts relative to their industry peers. Since almost all of the fruits (cash flows) they generated are used cover their debt obligations, they have little capacity to do investments or R&D. These firms are "Zombies" simply b/c they cannot move. 

However, this article from [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/3cb37eb1-97e8-44d9-9fa4-ef2a5649da8e?shareType=nongift) about the "Zombie" chipmaker - SK Hynix tells a very different story. While SK Hynix is currently under the spotlight as the hottest company behind this AI infrastructure boom, it is not always the case in its history. Since its establishment in 1983 by Hyundai, Hynix was a creditor-owned “zombie” firm for many years following the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis and an early 2000s Dram glut. 

> Suitors came and went, including Micron, which offered $3.2bn in 2002 but without agreeing to take on Hynix’s $6bn of debts. The Hynix board rejected that deal. Not until 2011 did SK Group step in when it paid Won3.4tn to end what had become known as “the Curse of Hynix”.

> Many internal opponents were horrified by the idea of taking over Hynix. “There was an outcry within SK Telecom,” says Lee In-sook, director of consulting firm Platform 9¾ and co-author of Super Momentum, a book on Hynix published last month. “They said, ‘If we take over that company, we will fail. We will only pour money into it and then we will go under too’.”

This trend did not change after SK group taking over Hynix for many year. In the figure below, although the revenue was trending upwards, earnings did not catch up. The "Zombie" situation was not resolved.
