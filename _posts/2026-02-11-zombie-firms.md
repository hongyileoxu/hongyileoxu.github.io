In the finance literature, zombie firms are defined as firms who can generate cash flows barely covering its interest payments. These firms generally have lower operating efficiency and heavy debts relative to their industry peers. Since almost all of the fruits (cash flows) they generated are used cover their debt obligations, they have little capacity to do investments or R&D. These firms are "Zombies" simply b/c they cannot move. 

However, this article from [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/3cb37eb1-97e8-44d9-9fa4-ef2a5649da8e?shareType=nongift) about the "Zombie" chipmaker - SK Hynix tells a very different story.
